an impact. The team worked with 15 homeless men and women not as recipients, but as givers. Together, they cleaned up

Whether it's a full-fledged instrument or as small but as important  a plectrum or guitar strings set which is going to be used by the guitarist for at least 6 months depends upon the frequency of playing or shaker, every Contribution counts towards bringing joy to deserving individuals. Creation of collection hubs will take place in this phase.

Part 2: Home delivering smiles: One can donate us money, a contribution as small as 100 Rs will make a difference and will help us with the Logistics part To ensure a smooth process, the logistics of this campaign are divided into two branches:
(a) Instruments that need repair: Instruments requiring repair will be expertly handled, ensuring they are in optimal condition before being gifted to those in need.
(b) Instrument delivery: Once the instruments are ready, our dedicated team will deliver them to the deserving individuals, schools, or organisations, spreading happiness through the gift of music.

Part 3: Giving Smiles: One can give the most precious thing that is their Time and be a part of this campaign by providing one hour of music to underprivileged individuals. By dedicating just one hour over two months, you can engage with at least five individuals through music. Whether it's playing music together or providing music education, your involvement will create beautiful moments and bring smiles to those who need it most. One can just get out there and play music on streets or maybe in an old age home or an orphanage.

Social Media Impact: Throughout the campaign, we will encourage participants to share their experiences on social media platforms using the hashtags #StrumASmile. By doing so, we can amplify the message and inspire others to join in spreading joy through music. Your small contribution, like a guitar strum, can make a significant difference in someone's life.","Rs. 3.3 lacs, paving the way for 1800 children from government schools in Delhi to receive music education for an entire year + 170 instruments donated.",,Mental health advocacy,"creative arts,music","GT community campaigns,giving types",Thinking of using creative arts to enhance mental health or increase happiness,Google sheet,2024-7-8,Nthanze Jane,2025-3-19 4:21am,0

She is someone who had never considered herself as a ‘generous person’. After she went through the Starling modules, she was able to reimagine the meaning of generosity for herself and decided to activate for GivingTuesday last year. She wanted to support her community in some way, but she didn’t know what would be most useful. Instead of deciding for herself, she went to her neighbours and friends, who told her to approach the local old age home. She then spoke to the founder of the old age home, who said they needed blankets for the upcoming winter. She didnt have the means to buy the blankets, so she took on lessons she learnt from the modules and went out to speak with a local influencer/celebrity who she managed to convince. He paid for the blankets that she went out and distributed.

The project aims to spark and promote environmental awareness, community engagement, and the importance of sustainable climate and positive peace practices amongst Interactors (school children). 


Through this project, students will actively contribute to the local ecosystem by planting trees, thereby fostering a sense of social and eco-friendly responsibility towards nature, and create a greener future; and Rotarians will be coordinated to donate to the Rotary Foundation on GIVINGTUESDAY GENEROSITY DAY-DECEMBER 3, 2024. 





At this event, the aggregate funds generated for The Rotary Foundation through this avenue shall be announced for each Districts, and participants shall be trained and engaged in an interactive session on climate change mitigation strategies and the role of trees in the ecosystem (oxygen production, combating soil erosion, wildlife habitat, etc) for peaceful co-existence. 


Being a Rotarian & Club Admin Director of Rotary Club of Abuja Wuse II, I look forward to promoting the activities of GivingTuesday & the Spark Chapter in Nigeria, especially in helping to raise funds for the ROTARY FOUNDATION on the Global Generosity Day.

https://givingtuesdayafrica.substack.com/p/givingtuesday-spark-nigeria-champions ","PROJECT OBJECTIVES 
The School Kids’ Tree Planting Program called ""Green Roots for Peace"", aimed at engaging children in environmental stewardship while fostering a culture of;
-  Giving back to the #environment and  -  Instilling the pillars of #positivepeace. 
All in a fun-to-learn ways, the initiative will teach children the importance of giving back to nature, instill a sense of responsibility, and promote peaceful coexistence by working towards a common goal—preserving our planet in a positive peace environment.


Capacity Building and Environmental Stewardship: To educate Interactors on the importance of trees in maintaining ecological balance and combating climate change, and empower children to become advocates and Ambassadors for sustainable environment. 


Contribute to the Rotary Foundation: To inspire and encourage Rotarians to contribute to the Rotary Foundation by buying a donated tree seedling by the Brazil Embassy, at N20,000.00 each, and paying directly to the Rotary Foundation Account (against their personal names). This will boost Rotarians and District contribution amount to TRF, and yet provide avenue for community service project, thus making it an all-round win! 


Positive Peacebuilding through Community Engagement: To entrench and encourage teamwork and collaboration among children from diverse backgrounds, hence fostering a spirit of unity and peace. 


Sustainable Action: Interactors to plant and nurture species of eco-friendly and soil reclamation fruit trees in Schools and local Communities. Your very distinguished self is invited to the hybrid (physical and online) key stakeholder project finale on GIVINGTUESDAY GENEROSITY DAY-DECEMBER 3, 2024, at the Brazil Embassy, Abuja, where Rotary leaders will interface with representatives of:

Malawi - ,Malawi,"‘street Kid Broom’
This Is A Community Giving Initiated By Police Women Who Are Giving Tuesday Community Leaders In A Twon Called Balaka. It All Started Last Year During The Giving Tuesday Malawi Launch. When Nkhadze, Balaka Police Station Lead By The Officer Incharge In The District, And The Zomba Mental Hospital Rallied Together To Give A Hype Of The Function. When These Teams Were Approached To Work Together We Went And Towards Launching The Giving Tuesday Malawi With A Theme, Let’s Talk Mental Health’ The Team Did Not Hesitate But To Put Their Energy, Resources, Money And Time To Work Towards The Giving Tuesday Launch. After The Launch Gt Malawi Participated In A Global Giving Where We Continued To Talk About Mental Health We Went To Give Children Clothings, And Other Materails To A Ward At Balaka District Hospital And Also A Clean Up In The Childrens’ Ward And The Hospital Surroundings. A Report And Data Was Submitted To Giving Tuesday Data Commons Through Giving Tuesday Africa.
After These Activities We Continued To Work Together With Balaka Police In So Many Ways. I Joined The Police Security Executive Community Forum As A Fundraising Chairperson And Supported During The Music Fundraising Show To Raise Money For The Balaka Police Community Forum Within The District.
After This, Little Did We Know That The Officer Incharge Has Strenghtened The Giving Activities Within The Police, They Built A Restaurant Which They Raise Funds For The Needy By Using Funds Raised When People Buy Food And Drinks, He Continued To Inspire His Staff More Especially Police Women. Just Last Month The Officer Incharge Led The Women To Donate Examination Fees For The 44 Needy Form Four Students Who Were About To Fail To Write Examinations Becuase Of Lack Of Money To Pay For The Exams Fees.
Now, Giving Tuesday Malawi With Balaka Police Women Through The Officer Incharge We Are Planning To Start An Activity Called,
“The Street Kid Broom”
This Will Involve The Women Police As Community Leaders Who Will Be Mobilizing These Steet Kids And Ask Them To Be Cleaning Along Business Premises And Prompt People And Business Men And Women To Donate For Their Food And Wellfare Through The Police Women Who Are Already Organized. This Beggining Is Like This Because There Are Close To 800+ Street Children And Beggars In The District. The Advantage Of Involving The Police Women Has An Advantage That Most Of Them Have Or Were Already Involved In Pick-Pocketing, Theft And Begging In The Balaka Town. Their Involvement Will Help To Start Certain Rehabilitation Programs For The Needy If Enough Funds Will Be Raised In The Neer Future.

Similar to Finland’s Wheel of Fortune (One pushed for events and the other activation ideas)
Gamification - Good Deeds Generator (For corporate, public and NGOs)
To motivate companies, Slovakia introduced the ""Good Deeds Generator,"" a tool offering 120 ideas for kind acts, available both online via a QR code and offline with cards distributed to company break rooms and kitchens. Companies that registered received these generators, encouraging employees to engage in good deeds during breaks or Christmas parties.
A key partnership with Tesco stores in Slovakia, the main partner for GT Slovakia, enabled a special campaign. From December 2 to 8, 2024, customers could scan QR codes in Tesco shops to discover daily good deed ideas, with a unique QR code to measure the impact.
On the day of GivingTuesday, over 75 NGOs were involved, and 53 companies participated by sharing their activities and using the Good Deeds Generator. Additional collaborations with donation and volunteering platforms furthered engagement by offering new ways to ""donate time,"" such as mentoring opportunities through Slovakia’s Volunteering Platform.
Storytelling
This year, around 30 stories related to generosity were shared by companies, and 50 NGOs registered their projects for financial/material donations or volunteering. The initiative expanded to 6 cities, up from 4 last year, sharing stories of good deeds
